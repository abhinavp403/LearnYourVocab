This purpose of this app is to help users improve their everyday vocabulary by engaging with definitions and sentences of words on a regular basis and then translate this to everyday conversations in real life. 
It was from my personal experience that made me realize that being exposed to new words frequently made it easier for me to comprehend them better and actually use it in sentences correctly.

The app's first screen consists of five empty text fields where the user has to enter their 5 words that they want to learn for the week. After all 5 words are entered, the screen displays these words which are
clickable. Clicking on any of these words shows the definitions and a randomly generated senetence from AI. The more you engage with these words, the better your understanding will be. After 7 days are completed,
the app resets to the first screen where the user once again has to enter 5 new words.
